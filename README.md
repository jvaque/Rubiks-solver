# Rubiks-solver

Just a fun project whith the objective of making a self Rubiks cube solver.

Cube is stored as a 6x3x3 array within an object, so there are six faces, and each is made of a three by three array containing another three by three array which stores the colour of that piece.

The object is expected to have face rotations added and later on other functions will provide scrampling of the cube and hopefully a solving algorithm.
